<p>They met at the gym.</p> \
<p>He was only able to see her for an hour a week. \
Every Tuesday at 5 PM, he would smile knowing that she would be there. \
He was nervous and fumbled his words around her, \
but eventually he caught her attention even if she only knew him as 'the cute funny coach.' </p> \
<p> They met for milkshakes and she was late. He waited for her knowing she was worth the time. \
From there they met each otherâ€™s families and friends. They traveled near and far. \
He learned to ski both on water and land. She ate, and ate, and ate some more. </p> \
<p>The two of them became devoted to each other. And you know the story from there.</p> \
<p>He made her dinner. <br> \
She made him organized. <br> \
He made her dance. <br> \
She made him laugh. <br> \
</p> \
<p>She wanted him to ask, and he wanted her forever. \
With a knee down and his nerves rattling, \
he asked if she would have him for the rest of her life. She thought about it, but of course said yes! </p> \
<p> Through all of the laughter, the workouts, trips to Maine and Fall River, \
the ups, and the downs, they were together. \
They met at the gym, but they became inseparable everywhere else. </p> \
